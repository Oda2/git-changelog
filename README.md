# About

This Rust-written CLI assists projects in generating a changelog without the need to install additional tools or create scripts with direct dependencies on the project. The idea behind this simple CLI is to effortlessly generate the project's changelog, integrate it into a pipeline, and include it in the generated artifacts. This CLI was originally designed for use in Gitlab, where there are no additional tools available for generating changelogs. You can publish the output of this script on GitLab Pages (or GitHub Pages).
